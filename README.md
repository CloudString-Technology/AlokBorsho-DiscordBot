# AlokBorsho DiscordBot
 A public bot made using [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) with features/games and so on!



# How to run

The bot script written using Lua programming language, Luvit as the runtime.

[Luvit](https://luvit.io/) is an open-source, asynchronous I/O Lua runtime environment. It is a combination of LuaJIT and libuv, layered with various libraries to provide server-side functionality similar to that of Node.js, but with Lua instead of JavaScript. Luvit's companion package manager, lit, makes it easy to set up the Luvit runtime and its published libraries.


Please rename example.token.lua to token.lua and edit before start the bot.

Once you do finish eiditng the token.lua, open the Command Prompt in the same directory where luvit and bot script files are. 

Then please type `luvit main` and the bot should be online!
