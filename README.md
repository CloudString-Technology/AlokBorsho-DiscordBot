# AlokBorsho DiscordBot
 A public bot made using (Discordia)[https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia] with features/games and so on!



# How to run

The bot script written using Lua programming language, Luvit as the runtime.

(Luvit)[https://luvit.io/] is an open-source, asynchronous I/O Lua runtime environment. It is a combination of LuaJIT and libuv, layered with various libraries to provide server-side functionality similar to that of Node.js, but with Lua instead of JavaScript. Luvit's companion package manager, lit, makes it easy to set up the Luvit runtime and its published libraries.
